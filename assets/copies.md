## 1. Professional Summary (Header and Main Block)

### 🥇 Senior Fullstack & Founding Engineer
### Scaling Products from Idea to 500k+ MAUs

> My career is defined by the capacity to act as a **Founding Engineer**: the individual who builds the core system from scratch and makes it scalable. With 9+ years of experience, I have navigated the complexity of creating hybrid technology ecosystems, combining the high performance of native mobile development (Android, iOS) with the versatility of advanced web platforms (Next.js, React).
>
> My specialty lies in **Cross-Platform Architecture and Convergence**. I have led implementations of **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** to maximize shared logic and reduce technical debt. My focus is not just writing clean code, but designing modular architectures that support exponential growth (up to 500k Monthly Active Users) and facilitate investment rounds, such as the **$3.4M Seed Round** we secured at Tacter.
>
> **My Mission:** To translate the business vision into robust and profitable technical solutions.

## 3. Experience (Extended Narrative)

### FOUNDING ENGINEER | Tacter (Oct 2020 – Present)

> **The Challenge:** To build a coaching and strategy platform for gamers from the ground up, as the first engineering hire. The core challenge was creating a multi-platform ecosystem (Web, Android, iOS) that was highly performant and scalable for a global market.
>
> **The Impact:** Developing a solid architecture allowed us to scale the product rapidly, achieving the milestone of the **$3.4M Seed Round** and becoming official Riot Games partners.
>
> **Technical Focus:**
> * **Advanced Cross-Platform:** I architected the mobile platform around **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** to share the Business Logic and Data Layer across iOS and Android.
> * **Innovation:** I led the implementation of **AI Features** (RAG Systems) to offer personalized game recommendations and **Web3 gaming** integrations.
> * **Fullstack:** Development of the landing page and user platform using **Next.js** and **React-Native**.
> * **Leadership:** Established initial technical hiring processes and mentored junior engineers.

### SENIOR ANDROID ENGINEER | JEFF (Feb 2020 – Oct 2020)

> **The Challenge:** Integrating multiple business verticals (laundry, fitness, etc.) into a single "Super App." This demanded a total architectural refactoring to support growth and the autonomy of multiple development teams.
>
> **The Solution:** I was part of the Core Team that successfully migrated and modularized large segments of the app from **Java to Kotlin**. This not only improved code maintainability but also implemented a Clean Architecture that decoupled teams, allowing for independent feature rollouts without affecting the entire ecosystem.

### ANDROID ARCHITECT | VITCORD (May 2018 – Dec 2019)

> **The Challenge:** Redesigning the core architecture of a video content social network looking to scale rapidly.
>
> **The Achievement:** I was the lead architect responsible for the new Android app in **Kotlin**, contributing to a platform that reached **500k MAUs** and facilitated the securing of **$3M** across funding rounds.

### OTHER RELEVANT EXPERIENCE (2016 - 2018)
